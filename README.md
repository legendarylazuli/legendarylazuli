<summary>click here to read more about me:</summary>
i only recently declared my major as computer science, so i don't have too much experience yet, but i've always loved anything computer-related, and i am eager to learn. 
please be patient with me as i become even more experienced and fill my github with even more cool things!
on my profile, you'll find things such as scripts, my websites, bots, and much more to come. i hope you enjoy the things i create!

i am currently in the process of creating my portfolio, and will update this readme in the future, but in the meanwhile, i will have my experience listed below:
